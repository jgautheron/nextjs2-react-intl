# `react-intl` example for NextJS 2

Unfinished example hence why I didn't send yet a PR.  
The redux store initialisation needs to be refined in order to not pass `intl: {}`.  
https://github.com/jgautheron/nextjs2-react-intl/blob/master/lib/withStore.js#L17

### Dependencies

```bash
npm install --save accept-language react-intl react-redux redux redux-thunk
```

### Credits

Code inspired from the Appollo & Aphrodite examples, and MERN-starter's implementation.
