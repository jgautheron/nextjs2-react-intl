# `react-intl` example for NextJS 2

Unfinished example hence why I didn't send yet a PR.  
The redux store initialisation needs to be refined in order to not pass `intl: {}`.

### Dependencies

```bash
npm install --save accept-language react-intl react-redux redux redux-thunk
```

### Credits

Code inspired from the Appollo & Aphrodite examples, and MERN-starter's implementation.
